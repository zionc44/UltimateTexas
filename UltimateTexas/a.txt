Now, there is a problem with the compareHands that you provided

in case of same ranke, e.g., onePair, the pair itself is not checked but only the kicker and therefore the result is in correct.

i believed the same problem is existing on other hand ranks, such as two pairs & fullhouses.

can you please fix the code to check the actual pair, two pairs and other, before checking the ckikers?
